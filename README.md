# Part 3 Objective 3 Creativity Feature
The implemented feature for the Creativity and Documentation objective is a button which will send you to a random post when you press it. 
The idea behind this feature is that as there are more and more posts, it can get tedious to find new posts - a way to randomly jump to a post can help fix that.

# Part 3 Objective 3 Testing Procedure
1. Navigate to our [public deployment](https://jjkm.org)
2. Using the up and down arrow on the righthand side of the screen, navigate through the posts and ensure there are at least 20 unique posts
    - If there aren't 20 unique posts, make new, distinct posts until there are at least 20 of them
3. Click on the "Get a Random Post" button on the page
4. Ensure that you are being shown to a new post than the one you were just on
    - Because there is a random element there is a possibility that you will end up on the same page too (this is attempted to be mitigated by the minimum 20 unique posts)
5. Repeat steps 3 to 4 anywhere at least 8 times
    - Keep a brief note/mental note of which posts you are sent to
6. Ensure that after repeating as many times as you want, minimum 8 times, the posts that you were sent to after clicking the button were in a perceptively random order.
